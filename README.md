# MediSnap - Smart Prescription Management System

## 🚀 Project Overview
MediSnap is an AI-powered pharmacist assistant that streamlines the prescription fulfillment process by:
1. **QR-Based Prescription Matching:** Scanning prescriptions to auto-fill orders and verify authenticity.
2. **Brand & Price Comparison:** Suggesting alternatives from different brands with the same chemical composition and comparing prices across package sizes and pharmacies.

This ensures efficient order processing, reduces errors, prevents fraud, and offers cost-effective medication options for patients.

## 📌 Problem Statement
A Pharmacist’s assistant, that automatically matches orders against handwritten prescriptions and creates orders for patients:
- **WHO Report:** 50% of prescription errors result from illegible handwriting.
- **NIH Research:** Generic drug substitution can reduce medication costs by up to 85%.
MediSnap aims to solve these issues through AI-powered prescription validation and cost optimization.

## 💡 Key Features
1. **QR-Based Prescription Matching:** Automatically fills prescriptions by scanning QR codes, reducing manual entry errors.
2. **Brand & Price Comparison:** Compares medicines of the same composition across brands and different package sizes.
3. **Drug Substitution:** Suggests affordable alternatives when prescribed medicines are unavailable.
4. **Secure Data Handling:** End-to-end encryption and role-based access for privacy.

---

## 🏥 User Journey
1. Doctor issues a prescription with a **QR code**.
2. Pharmacist scans the **QR code**, automatically filling the prescription.
3. If a drug is unavailable, AI suggests **affordable substitutes**.
4. Patient views the price comparison and selects the best option.
5. The pharmacist processes the order seamlessly.
